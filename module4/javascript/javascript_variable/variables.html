    // variables : a variables is just like a container where we store a information about data i.e called variable
        // var a=10;  var b=20; let a=10; let b=30;
        // let :let is used to assign any variable and let is not able to called globally.
        // var :var is used to assign any variable and var is  able to called globally.
        To use a variable, you've first got to create it — more accurately, we call this declaring the variable. To do this, we type the keyword let followed by the name you want to call your variable:


        let a=10; 
       let myName;
        let myAge; 
        document.write('Additions of numbers is ',c)
